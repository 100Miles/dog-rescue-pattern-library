The buttons use our primary colour the attract attention and stand out on the page. Different buttons have different purposes:

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and on a light coloured background.
- The light buttons are for reversing on a dark background.
- The ghost buttons are only for hero banners on top of an image.

These buttons respond to 'font-size' classes to change their size.
